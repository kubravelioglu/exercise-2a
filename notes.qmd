*creating new directory, make sure delete previous one that you previously cloned no to get any error about to clone a remote repository into your existing directory.

Here is R code for:

plot of the relationship between those variables on untransformed and log scale*


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
f <- file.choose()
d <- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE)
body <- d$Body_mass_female_mean
brain <- d$Brain_Size_Species_Mean
plot(body, brain)
plot(log(body), log(brain))
```

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
